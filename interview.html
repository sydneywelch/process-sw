						<h1>Interviews</h1>
						<p class="info">The interview process is a great way to collect more data on my client as well as the audience. Below are two sets of interviews done via email. The first set is questions pertaining to the client and the second set peratains to the potential user of the website.</p>
					</header>
					<!--Question 1-->
					<h4>
						What is your name, role, and job description at You Can Discover Change?
					</h4>
					<p>
						Heather Duncan, Founder of YCDC & executive Director.  As such, the job description changes as the ministry grows.  It started as a one man show and now we have several volunteers.
					</p>
					<!--Question 2-->
					<h4>
						How long have you been involved with this program?
					</h4>
					<p>
						YCDC start in 2017.  Our nonprofit status was granted in ________. 
					</p>
					<!--Question 3-->
					<h4>
						What is your favorite part of being involved with You Can Discover Change?
					</h4>
					<p>
						My favorite part is teaching inside our local country jail, York County Detention Center.  That’s were it all began.  I started the first LIFE Skills program for the women.  I teach a Torah centric LIFE Skills class.  The women wear orange uniforms the facility’s initials stamped on them, YCDC.  We have taken that labeling and created something beautiful,  You Can Discover Change.
					</p>
					<!--Question 4-->
					<h4>
						How would you describe the goal(s) and mission(s) of You Can Discover Change?
					</h4>
					<p>
						I have big goals for You Can Discover Change- I say the following ALot- “let’s  start something in York county that can be mirrored across the state. Let the impact of our unity be seen at the state level!”  YCDC started in the county jail, but we desire to have an impact at the state level.  There are hundreds of good people that would love to use their talents to make a difference in the lives of those incarcerated. They just don’t know HOW.  We fit the talent with the need!  Both the giver and the receiver are CHANGED!! Here’s our missions statement-The purpose of You Can Discover Change is to teach LIFE Skills to those incarcerated  physically and/ or spiritually. Life Skills is a Torah based teaching on living through the Holy Spirit. LIFE as Christ knew it to be...full of shalom, full of purpose, full of miracles, full of LIFE!!
					</p>
					<!--Question 5-->
					<h4>
						Do you feel as if the website for You Can Discover Change effectively conveys this(these) goal(s) and mission(s) as stated in question #4? Why or why not?
					</h4>
					<p>
						No; because the designer has to have the same passion about design as the founder has about the program.  Our website was a gift from a donor.  We do not pay any fees to host the sight.  Our design is a gift from previous participant who wanted to give back with her gifts and talents.  She has since found a career and is passionate about the employment for others.  She’s an Advocate in her industry to make sure that those with a less than lovely background can be employed with a sustainable wage.
					</p>
					<!--Question 6-->
					<h4>
						What is most important for your viewers to walk away with after visiting the You Can Discover Change website?
					</h4>
					<p>
						A desire to be apart of YCDC in anyway possible.  It takes a village!
					</p>
					<!--Question 7-->
					<h4>
						Can you explain the thought behind your current logo? Is this aspect of your brand important to you?
					</h4>
					<p>
						Logo was a donation also.  And very important.  The website doesn’t have our current logo (it’s beautiful and NEEDS to be on the page). You can view it on our Facebook page.  It’s also my fb profile cover photo - Heather Hall Duncan
					</p>
					<!--Question 8-->
					<h4>
						Anything else you would like to add? 
					</h4>
					<p>
						If you have suggestions for volunteers or minimal pay website work or helping with a better on-line presence just let me know :) It is definitely a need that will be addressed this budget year. I’m grateful that you reached out. Best wishes for your project.
